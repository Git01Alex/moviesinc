I recommend using expo on a phone to test this application, even though it works on the web
Follow these instructions to run the project
Make sure you have Node installed in your terminal; if not, you can follow the instructions on the node website https://nodejs.org/en/
after installing Node, just run the command "npm start," and the app will be exposed to port 19006 by default
In order to use the app, you can either scan the QR code generated on your terminal screen after running "npm start" or press "w" in the terminal so it can start the web version of the app.
